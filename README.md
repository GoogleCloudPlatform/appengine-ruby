Google App Engine Integration Tools
===================================

This repository contains the "appengine" gem, a collection of libraries and
plugins for integrating Ruby apps with Google App Engine. It is not required
for deploying a ruby application to Google App Engine, but it provides a
number of convenience hooks and tools for integrating into the App Engine
environment.

Currently, it includes:

* Automatic Stackdriver instrumentation for Rails apps. This means logs,
  error reports, and latency traces are reported to the cloud console,
  and debugger integration is available.
* A client and rake tasks for executing application commands in the App
  Engine environment against production resources, useful for tasks such as
  running production database migrations.
* Convenient access to environment information such as project ID and VM
  properties.

Planned for the near future:

* Tools for generating "app.yaml" configuration files for Ruby applications.
* Streamlined implementation of health checks and other lifecycle hooks.

## Installation

To install, include the "appengine" gem in your Gemfile. e.g.

    gem "appengine"

## Quick Start

### Rails Quick Start

If you are running [Ruby On Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) 4.0 or later, this
gem will automatically install a Railtie that provides its capabilities. You
may need to include the line:

    require "appengine"

in your `config/application.rb` file if you aren't already requiring all
bundled gems.

### Rack Quick Start

If you are running a different Rack-based web framework, include the following
line in your main Ruby file or `config.ru`:

    require "appengine"

Then, to activate Stackdriver instrumentation, add the following middleware:

    use Google::Cloud::Logging::Middleware
    use Google::Cloud::ErrorReporting::Middleware
    use Google::Cloud::Trace::Middleware
    use Google::Cloud::Debugger::Middleware

You can add the Rake tasks to your application by adding the following to your
Rakefile:

    require "appengine/tasks"

### Necessary permissions for remote execution rake tasks

If you are using the `appengine:exec` rake task, you may need to grant
additional permissions to the Cloud Container Builder service account that
runs the task, especially if you are using Cloud SQL (which is not covered by
the default permissions granted to the account). If your task is failing with
authorization errors, pen the
[IAM tab](https://pantheon.corp.google.com/iam-admin/iam/project) of the
cloud console, select your project, and find the service account with the name
`[your-project-number]@cloudbuild.gserviceaccount.com`. Add the Project Editor
role to this service account.

## Using this library

### Logging and monitoring

This library automatically installs the "stackdriver" gem, which instruments
your application to report logs, unhandled exceptions, and latency traces to
your project's Google Cloud Console. For more information on the application
monitoring features of Google App Engine, see:

* [google-cloud-logging instrumentation](http://googlecloudplatform.github.io/google-cloud-ruby/#/docs/google-cloud-logging/latest/guides/instrumentation)
* [google-cloud-error_reporting instrumentation](http://googlecloudplatform.github.io/google-cloud-ruby/#/docs/google-cloud-error_reporting/latest/guides/instrumentation)
* [google-cloud-trace instrumentation](http://googlecloudplatform.github.io/google-cloud-ruby/#/docs/google-cloud-trace/latest/guides/instrumentation)
* [google-cloud-debugger instrumentation](http://googlecloudplatform.github.io/google-cloud-ruby/#/docs/google-cloud-debugger/latest/guides/instrumentation)

Rails applications automatically activate this instrumentation when the gem
is present. You may opt out of individual services by providing appropriate
Rails configuration. See {AppEngine::Railtie} for more information.

Non-Rails applications must provide initialization code to activate this
instrumentation, typically by installing a Rack middleware. You can find the
basic code for installing these middlewares in the Rack Quick Start section
above. See the individual service documentation links above for more
information and configuration options.

### App Engine remote execution

This library provides rake tasks for App Engine remote execution, allowing
App Engine applications to perform on-demand tasks in the App Engine
environment. This may be used for safe running of ops and maintenance tasks,
such as database migrations, that access production cloud resources. For
example, you could run a production database migration in a Rails app using:

    bundle exec rake appengine:exec -- bundle exec rake db:migrate

The migration would be run in VMs provided by Google Cloud. It uses a
privileged service account that will have access to the production cloud
resources, such as Cloud SQL instances, used by the application. This mechanism
is often much easier and safer than running the task on a local workstation and
granting that workstation direct access to those Cloud SQL instances.

See {AppEngine::Exec} for more information on App Engine remote execution.

See {AppEngine::Tasks} for more information on running the rake tasks. The
tasks are available automatically in Rails applications when the gem is
present. Non-Rails applications may install the tasks by adding the line
`require "appengine/tasks"` to the `Rakefile`.

Note that you may need to grant additional roles to the Container Builder
service account that runs your tasks. If your task is failing with API
authorization errors, try granting the Project Editor role to the CloudBuild
service account.
