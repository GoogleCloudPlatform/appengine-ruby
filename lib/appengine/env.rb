require "google/cloud/env"


module AppEngine

  ##
  # A convenience object that provides information on the Google Cloud
  # hosting environment. For example, you can call
  #
  #     if AppEngine::Env.app_engine?
  #       # Do something
  #     end
  #
  # Technically, `Env` is not actually a module, but is simply set to the
  # `Google::Cloud.env` object.
  #
  # This is provided mostly for backward compatibility with previous usage, and
  # is mildly deprecated. Generally, you should call `Google::Cloud.env`
  # directly instead. See the documentation for the `google-cloud-env` gem.

  Env = ::Google::Cloud.env
