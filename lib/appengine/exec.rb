  ##
  # # App Engine remote execution
  #
  # This class provides a client for App Engine remote execution, allowing
  # App Engine applications to perform on-demand tasks in the App Engine
  # environment. This may be used for safe running of ops and maintenance
  # tasks, such as database migrations, that access production cloud resources.
  #
  # ## About App Engine execution
  #
  # App Engine execution spins up an image of a deployed App Engine app, and
  # runs a command in that image. For example, if your app runs on Ruby on
  # Rails, then your app provides a `bin/rails` tool, and you may invoke it
  # using App Engine execution---for example to run a command such as
  # `bundle exec bin/rails db:migrate` in the image.
  #
  # When App Engine execution runs your command, it provides access to key
  # elements of the App Engine environment, including:
  #
  # * The same runtime that runs your application in App Engine itself.
  # * Any Cloud SQL connections requested by your application.
  # * Any environment variables set by your application.
  #
  # The command runs on virtual machines provided by Google Cloud Container
  # Builder, and has access to the credentials of the Cloud Container Builder
  # service account.
  #
  # ## Prerequisites
  #
  # To use App Engine remote execution, you will need:
  #
  # * An app deployed to Google App Engine, of course!
  # * The gcloud SDK installed and configured. See https://cloud.google.com/sdk/
  # * The `appengine` gem.
  #
  # You may also need to grant the Cloud Container Builder service account
  # any permissions needed by your command. Often, Project Editor permissions
  # will be sufficient for most tasks. You can find the service account
  # configuration in the IAM tab in the Cloud Console under the name
  # `[your-project-number]@cloudbuild.gserviceaccount.com`.
  #
  # You may use the `AppEngine::Exec` class to run commands directly. However,
  # in most cases, it will be easier to run commands via the provided rake
  # tasks. See {AppEngine::Tasks} for more info.
  #
  # ## Configuring
  #
  # This class uses three parameters to specify which application image to use
  # to run your command: `service`, `config_path`, and `version`.
  #
  # In most cases, you can use the defaults. The Exec class will look in your
  # current directory for a file called `./app.yaml` which describes your App
  # Engine service. It gets the service name from this file (or uses the
  # "default" name if none is specified), then looks up the most recently
  # created deployment version for that service. That deployment version then
  # provides the application image that runs your command.
  #
  # If your app has multiple services, you may specify which config file
  # (other than `./app.yaml`) describes the desired service, by providing the
  # `config_path` parameter. Alternately, you may specify a service name
  # directly by providing the `service` parameter. If you provide both
  # parameters, `service` takes precedence.
  #
  # Usually, App Engine execution uses the image for the most recently created
  # version of the service. (Note: the most recently created version is used,
  # regardless of whether that version is currently receiving traffic.) If you
  # want to use the image for a different version, you may specify a version
  # by providing the `version` parameter.
  #
  # You may also provide a timeout, which is the length of time that App
  # Engine execution will allow your command to run before it is considered to
  # have stalled and is terminated. The timeout should be a string of the form
  # `2h15m10s`. The default is `10m`.
  #
  # ## Resource usage and billing
  #
  # App Engine remote execution uses virtual machine resources provided by
  # Google Cloud Container Builder. Generally, a certain number of usage
  # minutes per day is covered under a free tier, but additional compute usage
  # beyond that time is billed to your Google Cloud account. For more details,
  # see https://cloud.google.com/container-builder/pricing
  #
  # If your command makes API calls or utilizes other cloud resources, you may
  # also be billed for that usage. However, remote execution does not use
  # actual App Engine instances, and you will not be billed for additional App
  # Engine instance usage.
