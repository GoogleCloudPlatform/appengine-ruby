module AppEngine

  ##
  # # App Engine Rake Tasks.
  #
  # To make these tasks available, add the line `require "appengine/tasks"`
  # to your Rakefile. If your app uses Ruby on Rails, then the appengine gem
  # provides a railtie that adds its tasks automatically, so you don't have
  # to do anything beyond adding the gem to your Gemfile.
  #
  # The following tasks are defined:
  #
  # ## Rake appengine:exec
  #
  # Executes a given command in the context of an App Engine application, using
  # App Engine remote execution. See {AppEngine::Exec} for more information on
  # this capability.
  #
  # The command to be run may either be provided as a rake argument, or as
  # command line arguments, delimited by two dashes `--`. (The dashes are
  # needed to separate your command from rake arguments and flags.)
  # For example, to run a production database migration, you can run either of
  # the following equivalent commands:
  #
  #     bundle exec rake "appengine:exec[bundle exec bin/rails db:migrate]"
  #     bundle exec rake appengine:exec -- bundle exec bin/rails db:migrate
  #
  # To display usage instructions, provide two dashes but no command:
  #
  #     bundle exec rake appengine:exec --
  #
  # ### Parameters
  #
  # You may customize the behavior of App Engine execution through a few
  # enviroment variable parameters. These are set via the normal mechanism at
  # the end of a rake command line. For example, to set GAE_CONFIG:
  #
  #     bundle exec rake appengine:exec GAE_CONFIG=myservice.yaml -- bundle exec bin/rails db:migrate
  #
  # Be sure to set these parameters before the double dash. Any arguments
  # following the double dash are interpreted as part of the command itself.
  #
  # The following environment variable parameters are supported:
  #
  # #### GAE_CONFIG
  #
  # Path to the App Engine config file, used when your app has multiple
  # services, or the config file is otherwise not called `./app.yaml`. The
  # config file is used to determine the name of the App Engine service.
  #
  # #### GAE_SERVICE
  #
  # Name of the service to be used. If both `GAE_CONFIG` and `GAE_SERVICE` are
  # provided and imply different service names, an error will be raised.
  #
  # #### GAE_VERSION
  #
  # The version of the service, used to identify which application image to
  # use to run your command. If not specified, uses the most recently created
  # version, regardless of whether that version is actually serving traffic.
  #
  # #### GAE_TIMEOUT
  #
  # Amount of time to wait before appengine:exec terminates the command.
  # Expressed as a string formatted like: "2h15m10s". Default is "10m".

rake appengine:exec

This Rake task executes a given command in the context of an App Engine
application, using App Engine remote execution. For more information,
on this capability, see the AppEngine::Exec documentation at
http://www.rubydoc.info/gems/appengine/AppEngine/Exec

The command to be run may either be provided as a rake argument, or as
command line arguments delimited by two dashes `--`. (The dashes are
needed to separate your command from rake arguments and flags.)
For example, to run a production database migration, you can run either
of the following equivalent commands:

    bundle exec rake "appengine:exec[bundle exec bin/rails db:migrate]"
    bundle exec rake appengine:exec -- bundle exec bin/rails db:migrate

To display these usage instructions, provide two dashes but no command:

    bundle exec rake appengine:exec --

You may customize the behavior of App Engine execution through a few
enviroment variable parameters. These are set via the normal mechanism at
the end of a rake command line. For example, to set GAE_CONFIG:

    bundle exec rake appengine:exec GAE_CONFIG=myservice.yaml -- bundle exec bin/rails db:migrate

Be sure to set these parameters before the double dash. Any arguments
following the double dash are interpreted as part of the command itself.

The following environment variable parameters are supported:

GAE_CONFIG

  Path to the App Engine config file, used when your app has multiple
  services, or the config file is otherwise not called `./app.yaml`. The
  config file is used to determine the name of the App Engine service.

GAE_SERVICE

  Name of the service to be used. If both `GAE_CONFIG` and `GAE_SERVICE`
  are provided and imply different service names, an error will be raised.

GAE_VERSION

  The version of the service, used to identify which application image to
  use to run your command. If not specified, uses the most recently created
  version, regardless of whether that version is actually serving traffic.

GAE_TIMEOUT

  Amount of time to wait before appengine:exec terminates the command.
  Expressed as a string formatted like: "2h15m10s". Default is "10m".

This rake task is provided by the "appengine" gem. To make these tasks
available, add the following line to your Rakefile:

    require "appengine/tasks"

If your app uses Ruby on Rails, the gem provides a railtie that adds its
tasks automatically, so you don't have to do anything beyond adding the
gem to your Gemfile.

Specify the config file using the GAE_CONFIG argument. e.g.
  bundle exec rake appengine:exec GAE_CONFIG=myapp.yaml -- myscript.sh

Could not find any versions of service "#{ex.service}".
Please double-check that you have deployed this service. If you want to run

a service directly.
